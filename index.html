Hi Tanmayi,
I hope you are doing well.

Please read this message with an open heart and mind.
If this message hurts your sentiments in any way, I sincerely apologize in advance.

I know this may be unexpected for you, as we don't even know each other well. We have just met a couple of times in the clubhouse gym, and that too back in 2021. I still remember how I initiated the conversation by appreciating the poems you used to write on 'Cosmopoetica.' They are really beautiful, and I often read them. I wonder why you don't post now.

From the very first time I saw you, I felt a genuine liking for you. There was something special about you, a sense of calm and positivity in your presence, along with your kindness and humility.

Your name 'Tanmayi' truly suits you, which means ‚Äúone who is deeply absorbed in.‚Äù It reflects in your poems, your presence, and the way you carry yourself.
  </div>

  <div id="part2" class="message">
But I was never able to confess this to you, as we didn‚Äôt know each other well and still don‚Äôt, but we can if you want. I had once tried to reach out, but I wasn‚Äôt sure if you were comfortable, so I chose to respect the distance. After that, I tried to let go of these feelings and focus on my career, believing stability is important in life. But despite my efforts, the feelings quietly stayed somewhere within me.

I don‚Äôt know where I found the courage to write this today, but I know if I don‚Äôt express what I feel, I‚Äôll carry the regret of never speaking my heart, and that‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt want.

I know this message may be unexpected for you, but I really wanted to express my feelings for you.
If you‚Äôre open to it, could we have a chance? I‚Äôd love to get to know you better and see where things go (only if you‚Äôre comfortable with it).

If not, I completely understand and respect your feelings, and I genuinely wish you all the happiness in the world no matter what path you choose.

Once again, I am really sorry if this has made you feel uncomfortable or upset; that was not my intention and never will be.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this long message.

A Glimpse of You

I saw you once, and time stood still,
A quiet spark I couldn‚Äôt kill.
Not loud, not wild, not overdone,
Just soft and warm like morning sun.

Your name, 'Tanmayi,' calm and deep,
Like gentle thoughts before I sleep.
A voice I heard in poems past,
A presence that would always last.

I don‚Äôt know where your journey flows,
What dreams you chase, what path you chose.
But if these words reach where you are,
Just know someone still wishes from afar.

No rush, no plans set in stone,
Just hope our paths cross when the time is our own.
