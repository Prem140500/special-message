        <p>Hi Tanmayi, <br> I hope you are doing well.</p>
        <p>Please read this message with an open heart and mind. If this hurts your sentiments in any way, I sincerely apologize in advance.</p>
        <p>I know this is way too direct, as we don't even know each other well. We have just met a couple of times in the clubhouse gym, and that too back in 2021. I still remember how I started a conversation with you by appreciating the poems you used to write on Cosmopetica. They were really amazing, and I still wonder why you don't post now.</p>
        <p>From the very first time I saw you, I started liking you and I still do. There was something special about you. Your aura felt full of positivity, something that‚Äôs rare. Your kindness and humbleness deeply moved me.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="part2" class="message-section">
        <p>Your name 'Tanmayi' truly suits you which means ‚Äúone who is deeply absorbed in‚Äù. It reflects in your poems, your presence, and the way you carry yourself. </p>
        <p>But I was never able to confess this to you, as we didn‚Äôt know each other well and still don‚Äôt but we can. I also tried to connect with you, but when you didn‚Äôt reply to the birthday wish, it disheartened me.</p>
        <p>After that, I decided to let go of these feelings and focus on my career, as I believe stability is essential in life. But despite my efforts, I could never truly move on.</p>
        <p>I don‚Äôt know where I found the courage to write this today, but the only thing I know is if I don‚Äôt express myself now, I will regret it for the rest of my life, and that‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt want.</p>
        <p>I know this message may be unexpected for you, but I really wanted to express my feelings for you. If you‚Äôre open to it, can we have a chance? I‚Äôd love to get to know you better and see where things go (only if you‚Äôre comfortable with it).</p>
    </div>

    <div id="part3" class="message-section">
        <p>If not, I completely understand and respect your feelings, and I genuinely wish you all the happiness in the world no matter what path you choose.</p>
        <p>Once again, I am really sorry if this has made you feel uncomfortable or upset, that was never my intention and never will be. I just wanted to share what was in my heart.</p>
        <p>Thank you so much for taking out time to read this long message.</p>

        <h3>A Glimpse of You</h3>
        <p>I saw you once, and time stood still, <br> A quiet spark I couldn‚Äôt kill. <br> Not loud, not wild, not overdone, <br> Just soft and warm like morning sun.</p>
        <p>Your name, 'Tanmayi' calm and deep, <br> Like gentle thoughts before I sleep. <br> A voice I heard in poems past, <br> A presence that would always last.</p>
        <p>I don‚Äôt know where your journey flows, <br> What dreams you chase, what path you chose. <br> But if these words reach where you are, <br> Just know someone still wishes from afar.</p>
        <p>No rush, no plans set in stone, <br> Just hope our paths cross when the time is our own.</p>
