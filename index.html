            <p>Hi Tanmayi, <br>I hope you are doing well.<br><br>Please read this message with an open heart and mind. If this hurts your sentiments in any way, I sincerely apologize in advance.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="message2" class="message-part">
            <p>I know this is way too direct, as we don't even know each other well. We have just met a couple of times in the clubhouse gym, and that too back in 2021. I still remember how I started a conversation with you by appreciating the poems you used to write on Cosmopetica. They were really amazing, and I still wonder why you don't post now.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="message3" class="message-part">
            <p>From the very first time I saw you, I started liking you and I still do. There was something special about you. Your aura felt full of positivity, something that's rare. Your kindness and humbleness deeply moved me.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="message4" class="message-part">
            <p>Your name 'Tanmayi' truly suits you, which means ‚Äúone who is deeply absorbed in‚Äù. It reflects in your poems, your presence, and the way you carry yourself.<br><br>But I was never able to confess this to you, as we didn‚Äôt know each other well and still don‚Äôt but we can. I also tried to connect with you, but when you didn‚Äôt reply to my birthday wish, it disheartened me.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="message5" class="message-part">
            <p>After that, I decided to let go of these feelings and focus on my career, as I believe stability is essential in life. But despite my efforts, I could never truly move on.<br><br>I don‚Äôt know where I found the courage to write this today, but the only thing I know is if I don‚Äôt express myself now, I will regret it for the rest of my life, and that‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt want.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="message6" class="message-part">
            <p>I know this message may be unexpected for you, but I really wanted to express my feelings for you. If you‚Äôre open to it, can we have a chance? I‚Äôd love to get to know you better and see where things go (only if you‚Äôre comfortable with it).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="message7" class="message-part">
            <p>If not, I completely understand and respect your feelings, and I genuinely wish you all the happiness in the world no matter what path you choose.<br><br>Once again, I am really sorry if this has made you feel uncomfortable or upset, that was never my intention and never will be. I just wanted to share what was in my heart.<br><br>Thank you so much for taking out time to read this long message.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="message9" class="message-part">
            <p>A Glimpse of You<br>I saw you once, and time stood still, <br>A quiet spark I couldn‚Äôt kill. <br>Not loud, not wild, not overdone, <br>Just soft and warm like morning sun.<br><br>Your name, 'Tanmayi' calm and deep, <br>Like gentle thoughts before I sleep. <br>A voice I heard in poems past, <br>A presence that would always last.<br><br>I don‚Äôt know where your journey flows, <br>What dreams you chase, what path you chose. <br>But if these words reach where you are, <br>Just know someone still wishes from afar.<br><br>No rush, no plans set in stone, <br>Just hope our paths cross when the time is our own.</p>
