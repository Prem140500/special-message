Hi Tanmayi, 
I hope you are doing well.

Please read this message with an open heart and mind.
If this hurts your sentiments in any way, I sincerely apologize in advance.

I know this is way too direct, as we don't even know each other well. We have just met a couple of times in the clubhouse gym, and that too back in 2021. I still remember how I started a conversation with you by appreciating the poems you used to write on Cosmopetica. They were really amazing, and I still wonder why you don't post now.

From the very first time I saw you, I started liking you and I still do. There was something special about you. Your aura felt full of positivity, something that‚Äôs rare. Your kindness and humbleness deeply moved me.

Your name 'Tanmayi' truly suits you which means ‚Äúone who is deeply absorbed in‚Äù. It reflects in your poems, your presence, and the way you carry yourself. 
  </div>

  <div id="part2" class="message">
But I was never able to confess this to you, as we didn‚Äôt know each other well and still don‚Äôt but we can. I also tried to connect with you, but when you didn‚Äôt reply to the birthday wish, it disheartened me.

After that, I decided to let go of these feelings and focus on my career, as I believe stability is essential in life. But despite my efforts, I could never truly move on.

I don‚Äôt know where I found the courage to write this today, but the only thing I know is if I don‚Äôt express myself now, I will regret it for the rest of my life, and that‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt want.

I know this message may be unexpected for you, but I really wanted to express my feelings for you. 
If you‚Äôre open to it, can we have a chance? I‚Äôd love to get to know you better and see where things go (only if you‚Äôre comfortable with it).

If not, I completely understand and respect your feelings, and I genuinely wish you all the happiness in the world no matter what path you choose.

Once again, I am really sorry if this has made you feel uncomfortable or upset, that was never my intention and never will be. I just wanted to share what was in my heart. 

Thank you so much for taking out time to read this long message.

A Glimpse of You

I saw you once, and time stood still,
A quiet spark I couldn‚Äôt kill.
Not loud, not wild, not overdone,
Just soft and warm like morning sun. 

Your name, 'Tanmayi' calm and deep, 
Like gentle thoughts before I sleep.
A voice I heard in poems past,
A presence that would always last.

I don‚Äôt know where your journey flows,
What dreams you chase, what path you chose.
But if these words reach where you are,
Just know someone still wishes from afar.

No rush, no plans set in stone,
Just hope our paths cross when the time is our own.
